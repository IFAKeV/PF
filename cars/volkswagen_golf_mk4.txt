Produce a modern line art illustration of a Volkswagen Golf IV two-door hatchback captured from a three-quarter angle. Finish the car in a deep black tone with defined highlights and assertive dark outlines that emphasize its boxy silhouette, dual headlights, and honeycomb grille. Lay out the composition in a landscape frame set against a stark white (#ffffff) background for strong contrast.
