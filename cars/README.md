# Car Illustration Prompts

The following prompt templates can be used with an external image generation service to create landscape-oriented illustrations.

## Usage Instructions
1. Copy a prompt from one of the files in this folder.
2. Paste it into your preferred image generation tool.
3. Request a landscape orientation if the service allows specifying aspect ratio.

Each prompt describes a specific vehicle rendered in a modern line art style on a white background.

For detailed guidance on which generators to use—including cloud services, local Stable Diffusion setups, and notes about Ollama—see [IMAGE_GENERATION.md](./IMAGE_GENERATION.md).
