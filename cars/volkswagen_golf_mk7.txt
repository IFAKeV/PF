This digital illustration showcases a Volkswagen Golf MK VII two-door hatchback in a modern line art style, viewed from a three-quarter angle. The car is rendered in a soft off-white hue with strong dark outlines, highlighting its smooth contours, detailed grille, and angular headlights. Present the scene in a wide landscape composition against a minimalist pure white (#ffffff) background to emphasize the sleek, graphic feel of the design.
