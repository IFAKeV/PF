Design a landscape-oriented digital illustration of a BMW E92 coupe rendered in a contemporary line art aesthetic. View the vehicle from a three-quarter perspective and finish the paint in a refined bronze or champagne tone, accented by pronounced dark outlines that trace the coupe's flowing shoulder line, kidney grille, and aggressive headlights. Place the car on a minimalist pure white (#ffffff) background to keep the focus on the metallic hue and sculpted surfaces.
